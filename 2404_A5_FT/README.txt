******COMP2404 ASSIGNMENT 5******
Due Date: Wednesday April 11, 2018, 12:00 Noon

******AUTHOR******
Name: Farhoud Talebi
Student Number: 100965969

******PURPOSE******
Purpose of this assignment was to further expand on our previous mechanic shop application and add more software engineering principles to the design.
A generic LinkedList template was implemented to hold all Person and Vehicle types (or any other type) and implement a hiearchy.
Another hiearchy was added by making the Vehicle class abstract and adding a pure virtual function. This also allowed us to display different information for each Vehicle type.
A VehicleFactory class was implemented to handle the creation of all vehicle types and to further add more encapsulation.
